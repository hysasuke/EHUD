# Enhanced HUD (EHUD)

 

Enhanced HUD (EHUD) is a World of Warcraft addon that enhances the native WoW interface, providing additional functionality not available in the default UI. This addon aims to improve the overall user experience by offering various customization options and features.

 

## Features

1. **Enhanced Mythic Keystone Interface**: EHUD enhances the built-in Mythic Keystone interface, offering a more intuitive and informative experience. It provides additional information for your Keystone runs, helping you track your progress. Also, it provides one-click teleport button to easily teleport to dungeons you are running.

2. **Customizable Buffs and Debuffs Tracker**: With EHUD, you can customize your own buffs and debuffs tracker. Tailor it to your specific needs by choosing which buffs and debuffs to track, their placement on the screen, and their visual appearance. Stay on top of important effects during battles without cluttering your screen.

3. **Adjustable Combat Text Size**: EHUD allows you to adjust the size of combat text on your player's frame. Whether you prefer larger text for better visibility or a more minimalist display, you can fine-tune the combat text size to suit your preferences.

4. **FineTuneHUD**: This feature empowers you to fine-tune various aspects of the HUD elements with native HUD Edit Mode.

5. **Equipment Durability Display**: EHUD adds a durability display for your equipped items, ensuring that you're always aware of their current condition. Keep track of your gear's durability at a glance, helping you prevent unexpected equipment failures during critical moments.

 

 

 

**Note:** EHUD is compatible with the latest World of Warcraft expansion and is regularly updated to ensure compatibility with new game patches.
